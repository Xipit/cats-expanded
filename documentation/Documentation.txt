CATS EXPANDED

FABRIC 1.18.1 Mod

Targetgroup:
- All people who like cats
- Catear type of people
- vanilla gamers that want simple vanilla-like additions


Features:
- expanded Cat and Ocelot AI 
    * includes new catnip-high status
- catnip-bush generation
- catears
    * recipe            F F
      F -> Feather      FLF
      L -> Leather      L L
- instead of "MEOW" print a random cat fact on initialize
- catnip can be given to creepers and they will flee (will also flee from walking on ripe catnip bushes, else they will be slowed more)
- catnip works with composters
- catnip can be used to craft pink dye
- dyed catears

Ideas:
- catnip essence (catnip x9)
- cat paintings
- dyeable catears (maybe special version for catnip + catears? --> special model maybe) (need to implement custom item textures as well)
- particles when catnip high
- catnip induced catears tempt cats
- cat shrine (attracts cats, scares creeper, increases chance of catching fish in a certain radius)
    - maybe can enchant normal items with catnip to give them a cat related effect?
    - example:
        - fishing rod (higher chance to catch fish),
        - catears (eating fish gives more food),
        - food (can now be fed to cats),
        - books (transform into cat-only nametags),
        - sword (transform into cat-wand (summon cats?, attract cats, ...)
        - painting (transform into cat painting, only has cat textures)
    - crafting recipe similar to enchanting table, but includes fish and maybe catnip
    --> non-awkward way to implement very specific cat-related items
    - needs GUI (similar to enchanting table, but right side should be similar to crafting table. Needs special effects)
- more morning gifts (maybe after feeding them -> chances increase?)

Issues:
- [SOLVED] when cat is owned, one cant right click to feed them catnip
